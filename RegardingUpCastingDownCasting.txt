Upcasting and Downcasting in Java
A process of converting one data type to another is known as Typecasting and Upcasting and Downcasting is the type of object typecasting. 
In Java, the object can also be typecasted like the datatypes. 
Parent and Child objects are two types of objects. 
So, there are two types of typecasting possible for an object, i.e., Parent to Child and Child to Parent or can say Upcasting and Downcasting.

Typecasting is used to ensure whether variables are correctly processed by a function or not. In Upcasting and Downcasting, we typecast a child object to a parent object and a parent object to a child object simultaneously. We can perform Upcasting implicitly or explicitly, but downcasting cannot be implicitly possible.
